>[!tip] To measure Computational speed we check number number of calculations  

### Runtime Analysis
>[!define] Runtime Analysis: find the number of primitive operations that the algorithm performs as the function of its input size

#### Using 'Random Access Machine' model of computation
- Any number that occupies storage can and/or be written in constant time
- Each primitive operation takes constant time ($+, \space-, \space\times, \space\div, \space=, \space\sqrt\space\space, \space \text{floor and ceiling}, \space|\space|, \space$) 
##### Asymptotic Analysis

| Asymptotic Notation | Meaning   |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| $f=O(g)$            | $f\leq g$ |
| $f=\Omega (g)$      | $f\geq g$ |
| $f=\Theta(g)$       | $f=g$     |
