>[!define] Array: A fixed size sequential collection in which
>   1. The elements are stored continually in memory 
>   2. All the elements would be of the same size
> To put it simply they allow for random access ie. constant time for indexing

```python
lst1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...]
len(lst1)
```
To get it running in constant time

When an array is declared it is declared with a fixed size because of which its size cannot be changed however values inside it can be changed
