# QUESTION 1

"""
Problem - Given a word and a list of letters, determine if the word can be created using the letters.

Solution - Iterate (loop) through each letter in the word and check if there are enough of that letter in the letters.

  - Build up a "letter bank" by counting the number of times each letter appears in letters
  - Loop through the word using letters from the bank
    - If not enough letters in the bank, return False
    - Else, decrement the count of the letter in the bank
  - If we get through the whole word, return True

Letter bank:
  - Mimic a dictionary using a list
    - Each index represents a letter
    - Each value represents the count of that letter
    - How to convert a letter to an index? Ascii values
      - Each letter has a unique ascii value (a = 97, b = 98, etc.)
      - We can use ord() to get the ascii value of a letter (ord("a") = 97)

  - e.g.
    - letters = "apples"
    - [1, 0, 0, ..., 2, 0, 0, ..., 0] list of letter count
    -  a, b, c, ..., p, q, r, ..., z  letter represented

Some other possible approaches:
  - Just sort and compare the word and letters: return sorted(word) == sorted(letters) - but this only checks for exact letters.
  - Call .count() for each letter in the word and compare to the count in letters - but this is inefficient.
  - Loop through word and .remove() each letter from letters - but this is also inefficient.
