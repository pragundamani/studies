## Experimental objectives
- designed 5 trusses rejected 2 anf finalized 3
- used determinancy equation to check validity of trusses
- designs failed since nodes were not of matching angles



The Design
-The Design was an isocleles triangle.
-The base of the triangle was split into three joints
-Two joints were at the corners, one was at the midpoint of the base

Sizes
-Extra Small-15cm
-Small-25cm
-Medium-30cm
-Large-40cm
-Extra Large-50cm


First Experiment
-Experiment was a success
-We passed the minimum of two weights
-Our design managed to hold six weights
-When extra force was applied on top of the six weights the design collapsed
